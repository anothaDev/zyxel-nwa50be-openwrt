# Validation evidence

The following results were collected on one NWA50BE. They demonstrate that the
build worked on that unit; they are not a reliability guarantee for every board
revision or RF environment.

## Boot and storage

- Normal U-Boot loaded the kernel and DTB from NAND UBI and verified FIT hashes.
- Squashfs root and UBIFS overlay mounted read-write.
- The exact NAND layout was 512 KiB training, 256 KiB license, 60 MiB rootfs,
  and 60 MiB read-only rootfs_1.
- SPI NOR was absent from Linux MTD enumeration.
- Multiple normal cold boots preserved configuration and stable MAC addresses.

## Networking

- AP uplink negotiated 2500Base-T full duplex.
- Interface counters showed zero errors, drops, collisions, and output errors.
- A 60-packet routed management sample completed with 0% loss and sub-millisecond
  latency.
- AP-originated public-IP and DNS tests completed successfully.
- HTTPS LuCI returned the authenticated login boundary after reboot.

## Wireless

- 2.4 GHz normal and compatibility BSSes operated on channel 6 at 20 MHz.
- QCN6432 operated at 5975 MHz, channel 5, EHT160, WPA3-SAE, and LPI power mode.
- Close-range client PHY rates exceeded 2 Gbit/s.
- Measured internet download exceeded 1 Gbit/s in close-range testing.
- Multiple clients and a legacy printer re-associated after cold boot.
- Cross-BSS isolation blocked normal-to-compatibility traffic while the printer
  remained reachable from a client on the same compatibility BSS.

## Known limits

- MLO was deliberately disabled because early tests exposed peer-allocation
  failures in the downstream stack.
- 6 GHz range is materially shorter than 5 GHz at the same placement.
- The QPIC bootloader sometimes falls back from serial-NAND training to a 50 MHz
  feedback-clock mode; the training partition is preserved read-only.
- The image is based on a downstream Qualcomm/TIP stack, not upstream OpenWrt.
